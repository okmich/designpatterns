/**
 * Demonstration of a Chain of Responsibility Design pattern.
 *
 * This use case is a hypothetical work pipeline of how an individual
 * (TxnObject) works into an office. The first meeting would be a receptionist
 * and from there, the files and individual will process the txn by updating the
 * individuals txn log.
 *
 * The code assumes that the individual passes all stages but it is possible
 * that the individual fails a stage at which point the {@link TemplateDesk#doSpecificFunction(com.okmich.practise.designpattern.chainofresponsibility.TxnObject)
 * } will return {@code  false} and the chain will be broken.
 *
 * At the end of the chain or the transaction, we can see all that happened to
 * the individual by printing the txnLog to screen
 *
 * To avoid repetition of code across the Desk implementation, a Template Design
 * pattern was implemented to abstract the general behaviour across the
 * recruitment process and only provided a hook method for specific
 * implementation to all desk.
 *
 *
 * Other patterns used here include
 * <ul>
 * <li>Template Design Pattern</li>
 * </ul>
